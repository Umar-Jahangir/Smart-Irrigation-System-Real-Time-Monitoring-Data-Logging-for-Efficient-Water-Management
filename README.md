# IOT-based-Soilmoisture-Sensor-with-Water-supply-Monitoring-System

A **Smart Irrigation System** that automatically monitors soil moisture, controls water supply using a pump and relay, and records real-time irrigation data with a Python-based dashboard. The system ensures efficient water management by logging daily, monthly, and yearly usage, while providing visualization and export options.

## ✨ Features
- 🌿 **Automatic Irrigation** – Waters plants only when soil is dry.  
- 📊 **Real-Time Monitoring** – Live soil moisture, pump status, and water usage.  
- ⏱ **Accurate Logging** – DS3231 RTC timestamps irrigation events.  
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard** – Graphs for per-minute, hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly usage.  
- 💾 **Data Export** – Save logs in JSON and CSV formats.  
- 🔌 **Extendable** – Supports Bluetooth/Wi-Fi modules for IoT integration.
